# OnStage

React.js project consisting of the integration of an API (my choice from the following list: https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis).

Data had to be displayed in a table with first elements of the API, on clic in the table, the full description of the item had to be displaying.

 ## Requirements:

The API choice needs to make sense in a table format
The data table has to be max five columns and must be paginated
Use React and Material-UI
Design and UI matter: give them love
Within a week, provide:

the code, versioned in Git and 
a showcase of the app (github pages)
